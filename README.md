The proof of the existence of perfect secrecy through all-way functions
and computational difficulty through multi-way functions
in cryptography.
-->


### The proof describes a function--solutions to which are easily verifiable--but never easily discoverable. This check-marks one class of functions, but not the other. Namely P and NP. That discrepancy means this function is listed under NP but not under P therefore the two classes mismatch--mathematically represented as Pâ‰ NP.

* P class contains a list of functions with **easily discoverable solutions.**

* NP class contains a list of functions with **easily verifiable solutions.**
